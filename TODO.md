# TODOs

* Consistent SQL formatting
* Consistent CLI model
* More logging of changes, in particular explicitly show all "inconsistent" states (teams with no users etc.)
* Update to consistent naming (key / name / display_name)
* Standard "course" framework
* Migrate to custom Jinja-based rendering for individual problem pdfs, too
* Handling of referenced files

# TODOs

* Consistent SQL formatting
* Consistent CLI model
* Fix segfault of mysql connector?
* More logging of changes, in particular explicitly show all "inconsistent" states (teams with no users etc.)
* Update to consistent naming (key / name / display_name)
* Standard "course" framework (take from current LZSCC.223 + 111, including plagiarism checking and grade export)
* Migrate to custom Jinja-based rendering for individual problem pdfs, too
* Handling of referenced files in solutions etc.
* Long term: Migrate away from problemtools, implement (subset of) Kattis compatibility on our own
